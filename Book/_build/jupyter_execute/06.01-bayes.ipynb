    "The ideas I've presented to you in this book describe inferential statistics from the frequentist perspective. I'm not alone in doing this. In fact, almost every textbook given to undergraduate psychology students presents the opinions of the frequentist statistician as *the* theory of inferential statistics, the one true way to do things. I have taught this way for practical reasons. The frequentist view of statistics dominated the academic field of statistics for most of the 20th century, and this dominance is even more extreme among applied scientists. It was and is current practice among psychologists to use frequentist methods, although this is changing. Because frequentist methods are ubiquitous in scientific papers, every student of statistics needs to understand those methods, otherwise they will be unable to make sense of what those papers are saying! Unfortunately -- in my opinion at least -- the current practice in psychology is often misguided, and the reliance on frequentist methods is partly to blame. In this chapter I explain why I think this, and provide an introduction to Bayesian statistics, an approach that I think is generally superior to the orthodox approach.\n",

    "From a Bayesian perspective, statistical inference is all about *belief revision*. I start out with a set of candidate hypotheses $h$ about the world. I don't know which of these hypotheses is true, but I _do_ have some beliefs about which hypotheses are plausible and which are not. When I observe the data $d$, I have to revise those beliefs. If the data are consistent with a hypothesis, my belief in that hypothesis is strengthened. If the data inconsistent with the hypothesis, my belief in that hypothesis is weakened. That's it! At the end of this section I'll give a precise description of how Bayesian reasoning works, but first I want to work through a simple example in order to introduce the key ideas. Consider the following reasoning problem:\n",

So, what might you believe about whether it will rain today? You probably know that I live in Australia, and that much of Australia is hot and dry. And in fact you're right: the city of Adelaide where I live has a Mediterranean climate, very similar to southern California, southern Europe or northern Africa. I'm writing this in January, and so you can assume it's the middle of summer. In fact, you might have decided to take a quick look on Wikipedia[^adelaide] and discovered that Adelaide gets an average of 4.4 days of rain across the 31 days of January. Without knowing anything else, you might conclude that the probability of January rain in Adelaide is about 15\\%, and the probability of a dry day is 85\\%. If this is really what you believe about Adelaide rainfall (and now that I've told it to you, I'm betting that this really *is* what you believe) then what I have written here is your **_prior distribution_**, written $P(h)$:\n",

The problem is that the word \"likelihood\" has a very specific meaning in frequentist statistics, and it's not quite the same as what it means in Bayesian statistics. As far as I can tell, Bayesians didn't originally have any agreed upon name for the likelihood, and so it became common practice for people to use the frequentist terminology. This wouldn't have been a problem, except for the fact that the way that Bayesians use the word turns out to be quite different to the way frequentists do. This isn't the place for yet another lengthy history lesson, but to put it crudely: when a Bayesian says \"*a* likelihood function\" they're usually referring one of the *rows* of the table. When a frequentist says the same thing, they're referring to the same table, but to them \"*a* likelihood function\" almost always refers to one of the *columns*.

The question now becomes, *how* do we use this information? As it turns out, there's a very simple equation that we can use here, but it's important that you understand why we use it, so I'm going to try to build it up from more basic ideas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start out with one of the rules of probability theory. I [listed it](basicprobability) in a table way back in the chapter on probability, but I didn't make a big deal out of it at the time and you probably ignored it. The rule in question is the one that talks about the probability that *two* things are true. In our example, you might want to calculate the probability that today is rainy (i.e., hypothesis $h$ is true) *and* I'm carrying an umbrella (i.e., data $d$ is observed). The **_joint probability_** of the hypothesis and the data is written $P(d,h)$, and you can calculate it by multiplying the prior $P(h)$ by the likelihood $P(d|h)$. Mathematically, we say that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P(d,h) = P(d|h) P(h)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what is the probability that today is a rainy day *and* I remember to carry an umbrella? As we discussed earlier, the prior tells us that the probability of a rainy day is 15\\%, and the likelihood tells us that the probability of me remembering my umbrella on a rainy day is 30\\%. So the probability that both of these things are true is calculated by multiplying the two:\n",

    "In other words, before being told anything about what actually happened, you think that there is a 4.5\\% probability that today will be a rainy day and that I will remember an umbrella. However, there are of course *four* possible things that could happen, right? So let's repeat the exercise for all four. If we do that, we end up with the following table:\n",
    "\n",
    "|       | Umbrella | No-umbrella |\n",
    "|-------|----------|-------------|\n",
    "| Rainy | 0.045    | 0.105       |\n",
    "| Dry   | 0.0425   | 0.8075      |\n",
    "\n",
    "This table captures all the information about which of the four possibilities are likely. To really get the full picture, though, it helps to add the row totals and column totals. That gives us this table:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a very useful table, so it's worth taking a moment to think about what all these numbers are telling us. First, notice that the row sums aren't telling us anything new at all. For example, the first row tells us that if we ignore all this umbrella business, the chance that today will be a rainy day is 15\\%. That's not surprising, of course: that's our prior. The important thing isn't the number itself: rather, the important thing is that it gives us some confidence that our calculations are sensible! Now take a look at the column sums, and notice that they tell us something that we haven't explicitly stated yet. In the same way that the row sums tell us the probability of rain, the column sums tell us the probability of me carrying an umbrella. Specifically, the first column tells us that on average (i.e., ignoring whether it's a rainy day or not), the probability of me carrying an umbrella is 8.75\\%. Finally, notice that when we sum across all four logically-possible events, everything adds up to 1. In other words, what we have written down is a proper probability distribution defined over all possible combinations of data and hypothesis.\n",

    "The table we laid out in the last section is a very powerful tool for solving the rainy day problem, because it considers all four logical possibilities and states exactly how confident you are in each of them before being given any data. It's now time to consider what happens to our beliefs when we are actually given the data. In the rainy day problem, you are told that I really *am* carrying an umbrella. This is something of a surprising event: according to our table, the probability of me carrying an umbrella is only 8.75\\%. But that makes sense, right? A guy carrying an umbrella on a summer day in a hot dry city is pretty unusual, and so you really weren't expecting that. Nevertheless, the problem tells you that it is true. No matter how unlikely you thought it was, you must now adjust your beliefs to accommodate the fact that you now *know* that I have an umbrella.[^umbrella] To reflect this new knowledge, our *revised* table must have the following numbers:\n",
    "\n",
    "[^umbrella]: If we were being a bit more sophisticated, we could extend the example to accommodate the possibility that I'm lying about the umbrella. But let's keep things simple, shall we?\n",

    "In other words, the facts have eliminated any possibility of \"no umbrella\", so we have to put zeros into any cell in the table that implies that I'm not carrying an umbrella. Also, you know for a fact that I am carrying an umbrella, so the column sum on the left must be 1 to correctly describe the fact that $P(\\mbox{umbrella})=1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "What two numbers should we put in the empty cells? Again, let's not worry about the maths, and instead think about our intuitions. When we wrote out our table the first time, it turned out that those two cells had almost identical numbers, right? We worked out that the joint probability of \"rain and umbrella\" was 4.5\\%, and the joint probability of \"dry and umbrella\" was 4.25\\%. In other words, before I told you that I am in fact carrying an umbrella, you'd have said that these two events were almost identical in probability, yes? But notice that *both* of these possibilities are consistent with the fact that I actually am carrying an umbrella. From the perspective of these two possibilities, very little has changed. I hope you'd agree that it's *still* true that these two possibilities are equally plausible. So what we expect to see in our final table is some numbers that preserve the fact that \"rain and umbrella\" is *slightly* more plausible than \"dry and umbrella\", while still ensuring that numbers in the table add up.

To work out that there was a 0.514 probability of \"rain\", all I did was take the 0.045 probability of \"rain and umbrella\" and divide it by the 0.0875 chance of \"umbrella\". This produces a table that satisfies our need to have everything sum to 1, and our need not to interfere with the relative plausibility of the two events that are actually consistent with the data. To say the same thing using fancy statistical jargon, what I've done here is divide the joint probability of the hypothesis and the data $P(d,h)$ by the **_marginal probability_** of the data $P(d)$, and this is what gives us the posterior probability of the hypothesis *given* that we know the data have been observed. To write this as an equation:^[You might notice that this equation is actually a restatement of the same basic rule I listed at the start of the last section. If you multiply both sides of the equation by $P(d)$, then you get $P(d) P(h| d) = P(d,h)$, which is the rule for how joint probabilities are calculated. So I'm not actually introducing any \"new\" rules here, I'm just using the same rule in a different way.]\n",

In real life, the things we actually know how to write down are the priors and the likelihood, so let's substitute those back into the equation. This gives us the following formula for the posterior probability:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "P(h | d) = \\frac{P(d|h) P(h)}{P(d)}\n",

It describes how a learner starts out with prior beliefs about the plausibility of different hypotheses, and tells you how those beliefs should be revised in the face of data. In the Bayesian paradigm, all statistical inference flows from this one simple rule."
