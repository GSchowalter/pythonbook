    "\n",
    "This chapter introduces one of the most widely used tools in statistics, known as \"the analysis of variance\", which is usually referred to as ANOVA. The basic technique was developed by Sir Ronald Fisher in the early 20th century, and it is to him that we owe the rather unfortunate terminology. The term ANOVA is a little misleading, in two respects. Firstly, although the name of the technique refers to variances, ANOVA is concerned with investigating differences in means. Secondly, there are several different things out there that are all referred to as ANOVAs, some of which have only a very tenuous connection to one another. Third (and this is Ethan speaking now) _everything_ in statistics is an analysis of variance: analyzing variance is the entire purpose of statistics, so it seems a little unfair to give that name to any particular test. I challenge you to show me any statistical procedure that is not, in some sense, an analysis of variance. Still, Fisher got there first, so what can you do? Later on in the book we'll encounter a range of different ANOVA methods that apply in quite different situations, but for the purposes of this chapter we'll only consider the simplest form of ANOVA, in which we have several different groups of observations, and we're interested in finding out whether those groups differ in terms of some outcome variable of interest. This is the question that is addressed by a **_one-way ANOVA_**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The structure of this chapter is as follows: In [](anxifree) I'll introduce a fictitious data set that we'll use as a running example throughout the chapter. After introducing the data, I'll describe the mechanics of [how a one-way ANOVA actually works](anovaintro) and then focus on [how you can run one in Python](introduceaov). These two sections are the core of the chapter. The remainder of the chapter discusses a range of important topics that inevitably arise when running an ANOVA, namely [how to calculate effect sizes](etasquared), [post hoc tests and corrections for multiple comparisons](posthoc) and the [assumptions](anovaassumptions) that ANOVA relies upon. We'll also talk about how to check those assumptions and some of the things you can do if the assumptions are violated in the sections from [](levene) to [](kruskalwallis). At the end of the chapter we'll talk a little about the [relationship](anovaandt) between ANOVA and other statistical tools. "

    "Suppose you've become involved in a clinical trial in which you are testing a new antidepressant drug called *Joyzepam*. In order to construct a fair test of the drug's effectiveness, the study involves three separate drugs to be administered. One is a placebo, and the other is an existing antidepressant / anti-anxiety drug called *Anxifree*. A collection of 18 participants with moderate to severe depression are recruited for your initial testing. Because the drugs are sometimes administered in conjunction with psychological therapy, your study includes 9 people undergoing cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and 9 who are not. Participants are randomly assigned (doubly blinded, of course) a treatment, such that there are 3 CBT people and 3 no-therapy people assigned to each of the 3 drugs. A psychologist assesses the mood of each person after a 3 month run with each drug: and the overall *improvement* in each person's mood is assessed on a scale ranging from $-5$ to $+5$. \n",

    "## How ANOVA works\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer the question posed by our clinical trial data, we're going to run a one-way ANOVA. As usual, I'm going to start by showing you how to do it the hard way, building the statistical tool from the ground up and showing you how you could do it in Python if you didn't have access to any of the cool ANOVA functions that kind people have made for us. And, as always, I hope you'll read it carefully, try to do it the long way once or twice to make sure you really understand how ANOVA works, and then -- once you've grasped the concept -- never *ever* do it this way again.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experimental design that I described in the previous section strongly suggests that we're interested in comparing the average mood change for the three different drugs. In that sense, we're talking about an analysis similar to the [$t$-test](ttest), but involving more than two groups. If we let $\\mu_P$ denote the population mean for the mood change induced by the placebo, and let $\\mu_A$ and $\\mu_J$ denote the corresponding means for our two drugs, Anxifree and Joyzepam, then the (somewhat pessimistic) null hypothesis that we want to test is that all three population means are identical: that is, *neither* of the two drugs is any more effective than a placebo. Mathematically, we write this null hypothesis like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rcl}\n",
    "H_0 &:& \\mbox{it is true that } \\mu_P = \\mu_A = \\mu_J\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As a consequence, our alternative hypothesis is that at least one of the three different treatments is different from the others. It's a little trickier to write this mathematically, because (as we'll discuss) there are quite a few different ways in which the null hypothesis can be false. So for now we'll just write the alternative hypothesis like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rcl}\n",
    "H_1 &:& \\mbox{it is *not* true that } \\mu_P = \\mu_A = \\mu_J\n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This null hypothesis is a lot trickier to test than any of the ones we've seen previously. How shall we do it? A sensible guess would be to \"do an ANOVA\", since that's the title of the chapter, but it's not particularly clear why an \"analysis of *variances*\" will help us learn anything useful about the *means*. In fact, this is one of the biggest conceptual difficulties that people have when first encountering ANOVA. To see how this works, I find it most helpful to start by talking about variances. In fact, what I'm going to do is start by playing some mathematical games with the formula that describes the variance. That is, we'll start out by playing around with variances, and it will turn out that this gives us a useful tool for investigating means."

    "### Two formulas for the variance of $Y$\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, let's start by introducing some notation. We'll use $G$ to refer to the total number of groups. For our data set, there are three drugs, so there are $G=3$ groups. Next, we'll use $N$ to refer to the total sample size: there are a total of $N=18$ people in our data set. Similarly, let's use $N_k$ to denote the number of people in the $k$-th group. In our fake clinical trial, the sample size is $N_k = 6$ for all three groups.[^note1] Finally, we'll use $Y$ to denote the outcome variable: in our case, $Y$ refers to mood change. Specifically, we'll use $Y_{ik}$ to refer to the mood change experienced by the $i$-th member of the $k$-th group. Similarly, we'll use $\\bar{Y}$ to be the average mood change, taken across all 18 people in the experiment, and $\\bar{Y}_k$ to refer to the average mood change experienced by the 6 people in group $k$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Excellent. Now that we've got our notation sorted out, we can start writing down formulas. To start with, let's recall the formula for the variance that we used in, way back in those [kinder days](var) when we were just doing descriptive statistics. The sample variance of $Y$ is defined as follows:\n",

The only difference is that this time around I've got two summations here: I'm summing over groups (i.e., values for $k$) and over the people within the groups (i.e., values for $i$). This is purely a cosmetic detail: if I'd instead used the notation $Y_p$ to refer to the value of the outcome variable for person $p$ in the sample, then I'd only have a single summation.

This is very simple: instead of averaging the squared deviations, which is what we do when calculating the variance, we just add them up. So the formula for the total sum of squares is almost identical to the formula for the variance:\n",

    "When we talk about analysing variances in the context of ANOVA, what we're really doing is working with the total sums of squares rather than the actual variance.

So, instead of comparing individuals to the average of *all* people in the experiment, we're only comparing them to those people in the the same group. As a consequence, you'd expect the value of $\\mbox{SS}_w$ to be smaller than the total sum of squares, because it's completely ignoring any group differences -- that is, the fact that the drugs (if they work) will have different effects on people's moods.\n",

How does that help me find out whether the groups have different population means? Um. Wait. Hold on a second... now that I think about it, this is *exactly* what we were looking for. If the null hypothesis is true, then you'd expect all the sample means to be pretty similar to each other, right? And that would imply that you'd expect $\\mbox{SS}_{b}$ to be really small, or at least you'd expect it to be a lot smaller than the \"the variation associated with everything else\", $\\mbox{SS}_{w}$. Hm. I detect a hypothesis test coming on...\n",

In order to convert this into a workable hypothesis test, there's a little bit of \"fiddling around\" needed. What I'll do is first show you *what* we do to calculate our test statistic -- which is called an **_$F$ ratio_** -- and then try to give you a feel for *why* we do it this way. \n",

As usual, the degrees of freedom corresponds to the number of unique \"data points\" that contribute to a particular calculation, minus the number of \"constraints\" that they need to satisfy. For the within-groups variability, what we're calculating is the variation of the individual observations ($N$ data points) around the group means ($G$ constraints). In contrast, for the between groups variability, we're interested in the variation of the group means ($G$ data points) around the grand mean (1 constraint). Therefore, the degrees of freedom here are:\n",

In order to understand this, you need a slightly deeper understanding of what ANOVA is and what the mean squares values actually are. \n",

    "### The model for the data and the meaning of $F$ (advanced)\n",
    "\n",
    "At a fundamental level, ANOVA is a competition between two different statistical models, $H_0$ and $H_1$. When I described the null and alternative hypotheses at the start of the section, I was a little imprecise about what these models actually are. I'll remedy that now, though you probably won't like me for doing so. If you recall, our null hypothesis was that all of the group means are identical to one another. If so, then a natural way to think about the outcome variable $Y_{ik}$ is to describe individual scores in terms of a single population mean $\\mu$, plus the deviation from that population mean. This deviation is usually denoted $\\epsilon_{ik}$ and is traditionally called the *error* or **_residual_** associated with that observation. Be careful though: just like we saw with the word \"significant\", the word \"error\" has a technical meaning in statistics that isn't quite the same as its everyday English definition. In everyday language, \"error\" implies a mistake of some kind; in statistics, it doesn't (or at least, not necessarily). With that in mind, the word \"residual\" is a better term than the word \"error\". In statistics, both words mean \"leftover variability\": that is, \"stuff\" that the model can't explain. In any case, here's what the null hypothesis looks like when we write it as a statistical model:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_{ik} = \\mu + \\epsilon_{ik}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we make the *assumption* (discussed later) that the residual values $\\epsilon_{ik}$ are normally distributed, with mean 0 and a standard deviation $\\sigma$ that is the same for all groups. To use the notation that we introduced in the [chapter on probability](probability) we would write this assumption like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\epsilon_{ik} \\sim \\mbox{Normal}(0, \\sigma^2)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the alternative hypothesis, $H_1$? The only difference between the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis is that we allow each group to have a different population mean. So, if we let $\\mu_k$ denote the population mean for the $k$-th group in our experiment, then the statistical model corresponding to $H_1$ is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y_{ik} = \\mu_k + \\epsilon_{ik}\n",

    "Okay, now that we've described the statistical models underpinning $H_0$ and $H_1$ in more detail, it's now pretty straightforward to say what the mean square values are measuring, and what this means for the interpretation of $F$. I won't bore you with the proof of this, but it turns out that the within-groups mean square, MS$_w$, can be viewed as an estimator (in the technical sense: [estimation](estimation) of the error variance $\\sigma^2$.  The between-groups mean square MS$_b$ is also an estimator; but what it estimates is the error variance *plus* a quantity that depends on the true differences among the group means. If we call this quantity $Q$, then we can see that the $F$-statistic is basically [^note2]\n",

Therefore, at a bare minimum *the $F$ value must be larger than 1* to have any chance of rejecting the null hypothesis. Note that this *doesn't* mean that it's impossible to get an $F$-value less than 1. What it means is that, if the null hypothesis is true, then the sampling distribution of the $F$ ratio has a mean of 1,[^note3] and so we need to see $F$-values larger than 1 in order to safely reject the null.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be a bit more precise about the sampling distribution, notice that if the null hypothesis is true, both MS$_b$ and MS$_w$ are estimators of the variance of the residuals $\\epsilon_{ik}$. If those residuals are normally distributed, then you might suspect that the estimate of the variance of $\\epsilon_{ik}$ is chi-square distributed... because (as discussed [much earlier](otherdists)) that's what a chi-square distribution *is*: it's what you get when you square a bunch of normally-distributed things and add them up. And since the $F$ distribution is (again, by definition) what you get when you take the ratio between two things that are $\\chi^2$ distributed... we have our sampling distribution. Obviously, I'm glossing over a whole lot of stuff when I say this, but in broad terms, this really is where our sampling distribution comes from."

It might not be obvious from inspection what these commands are doing: as a general rule, the human brain seems to just shut down when faced with a big block of programming. However, I strongly suggest that -- if you're like me and tend to find that the mere sight of this code makes you want to look away and see if there's any beer left in the fridge or a game of footy on the telly -- you take a moment and look closely at these commands, and the many comments I have written, one at a time. Every single one of these commands is something you've seen before somewhere else in the book. There's nothing novel about them (though I admit that `reset_index` has appeared only once, and there aren't many nested `for` statements in this book), so if you're not quite sure how these commands work, this might be a good time to try playing around with them yourself, to try to get a sense of what's happening. On the other hand, if this does seem to make sense, then you won't be all that surprised at what happens when we look at the output of all this code, `Y`, and we see..."

    "I'm pretty sure I know what you're thinking after reading the last section, *especially* if you followed my advice and tried typing all the commands in yourself.... doing the ANOVA calculations yourself *sucks*. There's quite a lot of calculations that we needed to do along the way, and it would be tedious to have to do this over and over again every time you wanted to do an ANOVA. One possible solution to the problem would be to take all these calculations and turn them into some Python functions yourself. You'd still have to do a lot of typing, but at least you'd only have to do it the one time: once you've created the functions, you can reuse them over and over again. However, writing your own functions is a lot of work, so this is kind of a last resort. Besides, it's much better if someone else does all the work for you..."

    "### Getting Python to calculate ANOVA for you\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as you can imagine, there are several Python modules available that provided tools for taking the pain out calculating ANOVA's. `scipy`, for example, has `stats.f_oneway` which, in the typical, laconic fashion of `scipy`, spits out an $F$-value, a $p$-value, and not much more. We have already used `scipy.stats` above to find our $p$-value by hand. I am going to reccomend an entirely different package, though: `statsmodels`. These things go in and out of fashion, but for my money, `statsmodels` is quickly becoming the go-to Python package for anthing beyond a humble $t$-test. `statsmodels` builds on a more modern approach to statistics which goes beyond what we can deal with here, but suffice to say, that among other things, it is an easy way to get your ANOVA work done. \n",
    "\n",
    "The key to working with `statsmodels` is the `formula`, so let's take a look at that. A `statsmodels` formula (which will instantly feel familiar to anyone who has worked with the programming language R before) begins with the _dependent variable_ or _outcome measure_: basically the thing we are trying to undersand. The _outcome measure_ goes on the left side of the `~`character, which I read in my head as \"predicted by\". To the right of the `~` comes, unsurprisingly, the _predictor variables_, or _independent variables_ if you prefer. So, in our case, we are investigating whether or not there are significant differences between the three drug types: placebo, anxifree, and joyzepam. In other words, we want to know if variation in the variable `mood_gain` that can be accounted for by these three groups is greater than the variation within the groups. Or, in still other words, whether `mood_gain` can be _predicted by_ `drug`. So, our formula is `'mood_gain ~ drug'`.\n",

For now, let's just bask in the glory of the anova table that `statsmodels` gives us. We get the sums of squares, the degrees of freedom, the $F$-statistic, and the $p$-value itself.

Given that we've got three separate pairs of means (placebo versus Anxifree, placebo versus Joyzepam, and Anxifree versus Joyzepam) to compare, what we could do is run three separate $t$-tests and see what happens. There's a couple of ways that we could do this. One method would be to construct new variables corresponding the groups you want to compare (e.g., `anxifree`, `placebo` and `joyzepam`), and then run a $t$-test on these new variables."

    "This \"lots of $t$-tests idea\" isn't a bad strategy, but there is a problem with just running lots and lots of $t$-tests. The concern is that when running these analyses, what we're doing is going on a \"fishing expedition\": we're running lots and lots of tests without much theoretical guidance, in the hope that some of them come up significant. This kind of theory-free search for group differences is referred to as **_post hoc analysis_** (\"post hoc\" being Latin for \"after this\").[^note6]   \n",
    "\n",
    "It's okay to run post hoc analyses, but a lot of care is required. For instance, the analysis that I ran in the previous section is actually pretty dangerous: each *individual* $t$-test is designed to have a 5\\% Type I error rate (i.e., $\\alpha = .05$), and I ran three of these tests. Imagine what would have happened if my ANOVA involved 10 different groups, and I had decided to run 45 \"post hoc\" $t$-tests to try to find out which ones were significantly different from each other, you'd expect 2 or 3 of them to come up significant *by chance alone*. As we saw in [](hypothesistesting), the central organising principle behind null hypothesis testing is that we seek to control our Type I error rate, but now that I'm running lots of $t$-tests at once, in order to determine the source of my ANOVA results, my actual Type I error rate across this whole *family* of tests has gotten completely out of control. \n",

    "The usual solution to this problem is to introduce an adjustment to the $p$-value, which aims to control the total error rate across the family of tests (see {cite}`Shaffer1995`). An adjustment of this form, which is usually (but not always) applied because one is doing post hoc analysis, is often referred to as a **_correction for multiple comparisons_**, though it is sometimes referred to as \"simultaneous inference\". In any case, there are quite a few different ways of doing this adjustment. I'll discuss a few of them in this section and in [](posthoc2), but you should be aware that there are many other methods out there (see, e.g., {cite}`Hsu1996`). \n",

    "The simplest of these adjustments is called the **_Bonferroni correction_** {cite}`Dunn1961`, and it's very very simple indeed. Suppose that my post hoc analysis consists of $m$ separate tests, and I want to ensure that the total probability of making *any* Type I errors at all is at most $\\alpha$.[^note7] If so, then the Bonferroni correction just says \"multiply all your raw $p$-values by $m$\". If we let $p$ denote the original $p$-value, and let $p^\\prime_j$ be the corrected value, then the Bonferroni correction tells that:\n",

    "And therefore, if you're using the Bonferroni correction, you would reject the null hypothesis if $p^\\prime < \\alpha$. The logic behind this correction is very straightforward. We're doing $m$ different tests; so if we arrange it so that each test has a Type I error rate of at most $\\alpha / m$, then the *total* Type I error rate across these tests cannot be larger than $\\alpha$. That's pretty simple, so much so that in the original paper, the author writes:\n",

    "> The method given here is so simple and so general that I am sure it must have been used before this. I do not find it, however, so can only conclude that perhaps its very simplicity has kept statisticians from realizing that it is a very good method in some situations (pp 52-53 {cite}`Dunn1961`)"

    "Although the Bonferroni correction is the simplest adjustment out there, it's not usually the best one to use. One method that is often used instead is the **_Holm correction_** {cite}`Holm1979`. The idea behind the Holm correction is to pretend that you're doing the tests sequentially; starting with the smallest (raw) $p$-value and moving onto the largest one.

First, you sort all of your $p$-values in order, from smallest to largest. For the smallest $p$-value all you do is multiply it by $m$, and you're done. However, for all the other ones it's a two-stage process. For instance, when you move to the second smallest $p$ value, you first multiply it by $m-1$. If this produces a number that is bigger than the adjusted $p$-value that you got last time, then you keep it. But if it's smaller than the last one, then you copy the last $p$-value.

Up to this point we've been mostly interested in whether our data are best described in terms of a single grand mean (the null hypothesis) or in terms of different group-specific means (the alternative hypothesis). This makes sense, of course: that's actually the important research question! However, all of our testing procedures have -- implicitly -- relied on a specific assumption about the residuals, $\\epsilon_{ik}$, namely that\n",

    "- **_Homogeneity of variance_**. Notice that we've only got the one value for the population standard deviation (i.e., $\\sigma$), rather than allowing each group to have it's own value (i.e., $\\sigma_k$). This is referred to as the homogeneity of variance (sometimes called homoscedasticity) assumption. ANOVA assumes that the population standard deviation is the same for all groups. We'll talk about this [extensively](levene). \n",
    "- **_Independence_**. The independence assumption is a little trickier. What it basically means is that, knowing one residual tells you nothing about any other residual. All of the $\\epsilon_{ik}$ values are assumed to have been generated without any \"regard for\" or \"relationship to\" any of the other ones. There's not an obvious or simple way to test for this, but there are some situations that are clear violations of this: for instance, if you have a repeated-measures design, where each participant in your study appears in more than one condition, then independence doesn't hold; there's a special relationship between some observations... namely those that correspond to the same person! When that happens, you need to use something like repeated measures ANOVA. I don't currently talk about repeated measures ANOVA in this book, but it will be included in later versions. \n",

    "One question that people often want to know the answer to is the extent to which you can trust the results of an ANOVA if the assumptions are violated. Or, to use the technical language, how **_robust_** is ANOVA to violations of the assumptions. Due to deadline constraints I don't have the time to discuss this topic. This is a topic I'll cover in some detail in a later version of the book."

    "\n",
    "There's more than one way to skin a cat, as the saying goes, and more than one way to test the homogeneity of variance assumption, too (though for some reason no-one made a saying out of that). The most commonly used test for this that I've seen in the literature is the **_Levene test_** {cite}`Levene1960`, and the closely related **_Brown-Forsythe test_** {cite}`BrownForsythe1974`, both of which I'll describe here. \n",
    "\n",
    "Levene's test is shockingly simple. Suppose we have our outcome variable $Y_{ik}$. All we do is define a new variable, which I'll call $Z_{ik}$, corresponding to the absolute deviation from the group mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z_{ik} = \\left| Y_{ik} - \\bar{Y}_k \\right|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, what good does this do us? Well, let's take a moment to think about what $Z_{ik}$ actually is, and what we're trying to test. The value of $Z_{ik}$ is a measure of how the $i$-th observation in the $k$-th group deviates from its group mean. And our null hypothesis is that all groups have the same variance; that is, the same overall deviations from the group means! So, the null hypothesis in a Levene's test is that the population means of $Z$ are identical for all groups. Hm. So what we need now is a statistical test of the null hypothesis that all group means are identical. Where have we seen that before? Oh right, that's what ANOVA is... and so all that the Levene's test does is run an ANOVA on the new variable $Z_{ik}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "What about the Brown-Forsythe test? Does that do anything particularly different? Nope. The only change from the Levene's test is that it constructs the transformed variable $Z$ in a slightly different way, using deviations from the group *medians* rather than deviations from the group *means*. That is, for the Brown-Forsythe test, \n",

    "$$\n",
    "Z_{ik} = \\left| Y_{ik} - \\mbox{median}_k(Y) \\right|\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mbox{median}_k(Y)$ is the median for group $k$. Regardless of whether you're doing the standard Levene test or the Brown-Forsythe test, the test statistic -- which is sometimes denoted $F$, but sometimes written as $W$ -- is  calculated in exactly the same way that the $F$-statistic for the regular ANOVA is calculated, just using a $Z_{ik}$ rather than $Y_{ik}$. With that in mind, let's just move on and look at how to run the test in Python."

    "Okay, so how do we run the Levene test? Obviously, since the Levene test is just an ANOVA, it would be easy enough to manually create the transformed variable $Z_{ik}$ and then run an ANOVA on that. However, that's the tedious way to do it. Much simpler would be to just get `pingouin` to do it for us. Maybe I should take a drink every time I mention `pingouin` in this book. Then again, maybe I shouldn't!"

    "In our example, the homogeneity of variance assumption turned out to be a pretty safe one: the Levene test came back non-significant, so we probably don't need to worry. However, in real life we aren't always that lucky. How do we save our ANOVA when the homogeneity of variance assumption is violated? If you recall from our discussion of $t$-tests, we've seen this problem before. The Student $t$-test assumes equal variances, so the solution was to use the Welch $t$-test, which does not. In fact, Welch {cite}`Welch1951` also showed how we can solve this problem for ANOVA too (the **_Welch one-way test_**). It's implemented in `pingouin` using the `welch_anova` function:"

    "## Removing the normality assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen how to check for normality, we are led naturally to ask what we can do to address violations of normality. In the context of a one-way ANOVA, the easiest solution is probably to switch to a non-parametric test (i.e., one that doesn't rely on any particular assumption about the kind of distribution involved). We've seen non-parametric tests [before](ttest): when you only have two groups, the Wilcoxon test provides the non-parametric alternative that you need. When you've got three or more groups, you can use the **_Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test_** {cite}`KruskalWallis1952`. So that's the test we'll talk about next.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The logic behind the Kruskal-Wallis test\n",
    "\n",
    "The Kruskal-Wallis test is surprisingly similar to ANOVA, in some ways. In ANOVA, we started with $Y_{ik}$, the value of the outcome variable for the $i$th person in the $k$th group. For the Kruskal-Wallis test, what we'll do is rank order all of these $Y_{ik}$ values, and conduct our analysis on the ranked data. So let's let $R_{ik}$ refer to the ranking given to the $i$th member of the $k$th group. Now, let's calculate $\\bar{R}_k$, the average rank given to observations in the $k$th group:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{R}_k = \\frac{1}{N_K} \\sum_{i} R_{ik}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and let's also calculate $\\bar{R}$, the grand mean rank:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\bar{R} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i} \\sum_{k} R_{ik}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've done this, we can calculate the squared deviations from the grand mean rank $\\bar{R}$. When we do this for the individual scores -- i.e., if we calculate $(R_{ik} - \\bar{R})^2$ -- what we have is a \"nonparametric\" measure of how far the $ik$-th observation deviates from the grand mean rank. When we calculate the squared deviation of the group means from the grand means -- i.e., if we calculate $(\\bar{R}_k  - \\bar{R} )^2$ -- then what we have is a nonparametric measure of how much the *group* deviates from the grand mean rank. With this in mind, let's follow the same logic that we did with ANOVA, and define our *ranked* sums of squares measures in much the same way that we did earlier. First, we have our \"total ranked sums of squares\":\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mbox{RSS}_{tot} = \\sum_k \\sum_i ( R_{ik} - \\bar{R} )^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and we can define the \"between groups ranked sums of squares\" like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{array}{rcl}\n",
    "\\mbox{RSS}_{b} &=& \\sum_k \\sum_i ( \\bar{R}_k  - \\bar{R} )^2 \\\\\n",
    "&=& \\sum_k N_k ( \\bar{R}_k  - \\bar{R} )^2 \n",
    "\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the null hypothesis is true and there are no true group differences at all, you'd expect the between group rank sums $\\mbox{RSS}_{b}$ to be very small, much smaller than the total rank sums $\\mbox{RSS}_{tot}$. Qualitatively this is very much the same as what we found when we went about constructing the ANOVA $F$-statistic; but for technical reasons the Kruskal-Wallis test statistic, usually denoted $K$, is constructed in a slightly different way: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "K = (N - 1) \\times \\frac{\\mbox{RSS}_b}{\\mbox{RSS}_{tot}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and, if the null hypothesis is true, then the sampling distribution of $K$ is *approximately* chi-square with $G-1$ degrees of freedom (where $G$ is the number of groups). The larger the value of $K$, the less consistent the data are with null hypothesis, so this is a one-sided test: we reject $H_0$ when $K$ is sufficiently large."

    "The description in the previous section illustrates the logic behind the Kruskal-Wallis test. At a conceptual level, this is the right way to think about how the test works. However, from a purely mathematical perspective it's needlessly complicated. I won't show you the derivation, but you can use a bit of algebraic jiggery-pokery[^notejig] to show that the equation for $K$ can be rewritten as \n",

    "\n",
    "It's this last equation that you sometimes see given for $K$. This is way easier to calculate than the version I described in the previous section, it's just that it's totally meaningless to actual humans. It's probably best to think of $K$ the way I described it earlier... as an analogue of ANOVA based on ranks. But keep in mind that the test statistic that gets calculated ends up with a rather different look to it than the one we used for our original ANOVA.\n",
    "\n",
    "But wait, there's more! Dear lord, why is there always *more*? The story I've told so far is only actually true when there are no ties in the raw data. That is, if there are no two observations that have exactly the same value. If there *are* ties, then we have to introduce a correction factor to these calculations. At this point I'm assuming that even the most diligent reader has stopped caring (or at least formed the opinion that the tie-correction factor is something that doesn't require their immediate attention). So I'll very quickly tell you how it's calculated, and omit the tedious details about *why* it's done this way. Suppose we construct a frequency table for the raw data, and let $f_j$ be the number of observations that have the $j$-th unique value. This might sound a bit abstract, so here's the Python code showing a concrete example:"

Since we only have two groups, I didn't actually need to resort to an ANOVA, I could have just decided to run a Student $t$-test. So let's see what happens when I do that. First, I'll just re-arrange the data in to wide format:"

    "There's a fair bit covered in this chapter, but there's still a lot missing. Most obviously, I haven't yet discussed any analog of the paired samples $t$-test for more than two groups. There is a way of doing this, known as *repeated measures ANOVA*, which will appear in a later version of this book. I also haven't discussed how to run an ANOVA when you are interested in more than one grouping variable, but that will be discussed in a lot of detail in a [later chapter](anova2). In terms of what we have discussed, the key topics were:\n",

It's not a good book for beginners, but it's an excellent book for more advanced readers who are interested in understanding the mathematics behind ANOVA."

    "[^note1]: When all groups have the same number of observations, the experimental design is said to be \"balanced\". Balance isn't such a big deal for one-way ANOVA, which is the topic of this chapter. It becomes more important when you start doing more complicated ANOVAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^note2]: In a later versions I'm intending to expand on this. But because I'm writing in a rush, and am already over my deadlines, I'll just briefly note that if you read ahead to the chapter on [factorial anovas](anova2) and look at how the \"treatment effect\" at level $k$ of a factor is defined in terms of the $\\alpha_k$ values (check out the section on [interactions](interactions)), it turns out that $Q$ refers to a weighted mean of the squared treatment effects, $Q=(\\sum_{k=1}^G N_k\\alpha_k^2)/(G-1)$.\n",

    "\n",
    "[^note4]: Or, to be precise, party like \"it's 1899 and we've got no friends and nothing better to do with our time than do some calculations that wouldn't have made any sense in 1899 because ANOVA didn't exist until about the 1920s\".\n",
    "\n",
    "[^note5]: If you *do* have some theoretical basis for wanting to investigate some comparisons but not others, it's a different story. In those circumstances you're not really running \"post hoc\" analyses at all: you're making \"planned comparisons\". I do talk about this situation later in the book [](plannedcomparisons)), but for now I want to keep things simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^note6]: It's worth noting in passing that not all adjustment methods try to do this. What I've described here is an approach for controlling \"family wise Type I error rate\". However, there are other post hoc tests seek to control the \"false discovery rate\", which is a somewhat different thing."
