    "In the chapter on [Getting started with Python](getting-started-with-python) our main goal was to, well, get started with Python. As we go through the book we'll run into a lot of new  Python concepts, which I'll explain alongside the relevant data analysis concepts. However, there's still quite a few things that I need to talk about now, otherwise we'll run into problems when we start trying to work with data and do statistics. So that's the goal in this chapter: to build on the introductory stuff from the last chapter, to get you to the point that we can start using Python for statistics. Broadly speaking, the chapter comes in two parts. The first half of the chapter is devoted to the \"mechanics\" of Python: installing and loading packages, managing the workspace, navigating the file system, and loading and saving data. In the second half, I'll talk more about what kinds of variables exist in Python, and introduce three new kinds of variables: factors, data frames and formulas. I'll finish up by talking a little bit about the help documentation in Python as well as some other avenues for finding assistance. In general, I'm not trying to be comprehensive in this chapter, I'm trying to make sure that you've got the basic foundations needed to tackle the content that comes later in the book. However, a lot of the topics are revisited in more detail later. "

But one of the best things about Python isn't even the language itself, it is the rich ecosystem of code written by other people that you can use to make Python do things for you. These **libraries** or **packages** [^note2] contain code that people have written to solve particular problems, and then kindly made available for other people, like you and me, so that we don't have to spend our time reinventing the wheel. By installing and importing libraries, you can achieve very complicated things with only a few lines of your own code, by standing on the shoulders of others.

    "When doing anything other than the very most basic forms of data analysis in Python, we will almost always need to use libraries. However, before we get started, there's a critical distinction that you need to understand, which is the difference between having a package **_installed_** on your computer, and having a package **_imported_** in Python. I do not have any idea how many Python libraries are available out there, but it is a lot. Thousands. If you install Python on your computer, you won't get all of them, just a handfull of the standard ones. Depending on how you install Python on your computer, you may have more or fewer libraries installed, but either way, there are thousands more out there that you do not currently have installed. So that's what installed means: it means \"it's on your computer somewhere\". The critical thing to remember is that just because something is on your computer doesn't mean Python can use it. In order for Python to be able to *use* one of your installed libraries, that library must also be \"imported\". Basically what it boils down to is this:\n",
    "\n",
    ">A library must be installed before it can be imported.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A library must be imported before it can be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "This two step process might seem a little odd at first, but the designers of Python had very good reasons to do it this way,[^note4] and you get the hang of it pretty quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "I won't get into the details of installing libraries here, simply because it is too much for me to tackle. If you are using Python in an online enviroment, you may already have access to all the libraries mentioned in this book. If you are working with Python on your own computer, the exact details of how you install packages may vary. If you want to use Python on your own computer, and are just getting started, I recommend [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads) as a relatively easy way to install Python and get quick access to all the most common and important libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "[^note4]: Basically, the reason is that there are thousands of libraries, and probably thousands of authors of libraries, and no-one really knows what all of them do. Keeping the installation separate from the loading minimizes the chances that two libraries will interact with each other in a nasty way, like using the same name for different things. "

    "### What libraries does this book use?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this book, I have made a concerted effort to limit the number of libraries needed. Often you will find that you can use different libraries to achieve the same results, and sometimes one of these may suit your needs more than another. This is something that can make doing analysis by code rather than pointing and clicking in a dedicated statistics program a bit off-putting; in Excel, there is usually only one way to do things, while in Python, there are many. I think this is part of what makes doing statistics using code better, though: you can make your own informed choices, and do *exactly* the analysis you want to do; you don't have to accept some piece of software's default settings. However, the point of this book is to get you started doing data analysis and statistics in Python, not to show you all the different ways you could achieve the same goal, so in an effort to keep things simple, I have tried to limit the libraries used in this book to a few of the most important and most common ones for doing statistics with Python. The libraries we will return to again and again are: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statistics`, `math`, and `pingouin`, but I may use others as well, as needed. Other powerful libraries that I won't make much use of in this book, but that you will probably end up using at some point if you continue to do statistics with Python include `scipy`, `statmodels`, and `scikit-learn`.\n",

So, if I have imported e.g. `numpy` early in the chapter, I don't need to do it again in a later section of the chapter. But, normally I will, because I want the code snippets in this book to be as easy as possible to copy and paste into your own computer. If I don't put the `import` command at the top of the snippet, and you have not already imported the library, then you might copy and paste my code into your computer and get an error message. Then again, sometimes I might forget to put the import statement in, or I might think it should be obvious, or I might just get lazy, so make sure to keep an eye out for this!\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section I describe the basic idea behind file locations and file paths. Regardless of whether you're using Window, macOS or Linux, every file on the computer is assigned a (fairly) human readable address, and every address has the same basic structure: it describes a *path* that starts from a *root* location, through as series of *folders* (or if you're an old-school computer user, *directories*), and finally ends up at the file. \n",
    "\n",
    "On a Windows computer the root is the physical drive [^notedrive] on which the file is stored, and for most home computers the name of the hard drive that stores all your files is C: and therefore most file paths on Windows begin with C:. After that come the folders, and on Windows the folder names are separated by a `\\` symbol. So, the complete path to this book on my Windows computer might be something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:\\Users\\ethan\\pythonbook\\book\\LSP.pdf\n",
    "```\n",
    "and what that *means* is that the book is called LSP.pdf, and it's in a folder called `book` which itself is in a folder called `ethan` which itself is ... well, you get the idea. On Linux, Unix and Mac OS systems, the addresses look a little different, but they're more or less identical in spirit. Instead of using the backslash, folders are separated using a forward slash, and unlike Windows, they don't treat the physical drive as being the root of the file system. So, the path to this book on my Mac might be something like this:\n",

There are (again!) multiple ways to do this on the various operating systems, and it doesn't really matter which method you use. A quick search will lead you to many many online tutorials; just find a method that works for you, on your computer. Even if you are working in a virtual Python environment in the browser (such as Google Colab), you will need some concept of file structure to navigate to your data and scripts.\n",

    "But, although most of us who aren't mathematicians or computer scientists or whatever can go blissfully through life being unaware of it, there are many [different strategies for rounding numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding). Python uses the one known as \"[rounding half to even](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rounding#Rounding_half_to_even)\", which means that when there is a tie, that is, when the number we want to round is exactly halfway between two integers, Python will round to the nearest _even_ number. Now, unlike 0.1, which as we saw above, is stored as an approximation of an infinitely long series in base 2, 0.5 is actually stored as a precise number in base 2[^base2.5], which means that even to Python, 1.5 is exactly halfway between 1 and 2, and 2.5 is halfway between 2 and 3. And, when deciding ties Python rounds to the neares even number, we can get some surprising results:\n",

Because, wouldn't that be the fourth number, if we start counting at zero. Yes, it would, except that Python slices _end_ with the item in the position indicated by the second number _not including that number_! So when we write `[0:5]`, Python starts counting at 0, then includes everything up to one less than the final number. Sometimes I think the authors of Python are just messing with us.
