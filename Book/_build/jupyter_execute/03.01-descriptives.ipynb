    "Any time that you get a new data set to look at, one of the first tasks that you have to do is find ways of summarising the data in a compact, easily understood fashion. This is what **_descriptive statistics_** (as opposed to inferential statistics) is all about. In fact, to many people the term \"statistics\" is synonymous with descriptive statistics. It is this topic that we'll consider in this chapter, but before going into any details, let's take a moment to get a sense of why we need descriptive statistics. To do this, let's load the `afl_finalists.csv` and `afl_margins.csv` files. Don't worry about the Python code for now; we'll get back to that. For now, we'll focus on the data."

    "There are two variables here, `afl_finalists` and `afl_margins`. We'll focus a bit on these two variables in this chapter, so I'd better tell you what they are. Unlike most of data sets in this book, these are actually real data, relating to the Australian Football League (AFL) [^note1] The `afl_margins` variable contains the winning margin (number of points) for all 176 home and away games played during the 2010 season. The `afl_finalists` variable contains the names of all 400 teams that played in all 200 finals matches played during the period 1987 to 2010.  Let's have a look at the `afl_margins` variable:\n",

    "This output doesn't make it easy to get a sense of what the data are actually saying. Just \"looking at the data\" isn't a terribly effective way of understanding data. In order to get some idea about what's going on, we need to calculate some descriptive statistics (this chapter) and draw some nice pictures (next chapter). Since the descriptive statistics are the easier of the two topics, I'll start with those, but nevertheless I'll show you a histogram of the `afl_margins` data, since it should help you get a sense of what the data we're trying to describe actually look like. But for what it's worth, this histogram was generated using the `histplot()` function from the `seaborn` package. We'll talk a lot more about how to draw histograms in [](DrawingGraphs). For now, it's enough to look at the histogram and note that it provides a fairly interpretable representation of the `afl_margins` data."

    "\n",
    "Athough drawing pictures of the data, as I did in {numref}`fig-AFL-Margins` is an excellent way to convey the \"gist\" of what the data is trying to tell you, it's often extremely useful to try to condense the data into a few simple \"summary\" statistics. In most situations, the first thing that you'll want to calculate is a measure of **_central tendency_**. That is, you'd like to know something about the \"average\" or \"middle\" of your data lies. The two most commonly used measures are the mean, median and mode; occasionally people will also report a trimmed mean. I'll explain each of these in turn, and then discuss when each of them is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The mean\n",
    "\n",
    "The **_mean_** of a set of observations is just a normal, old-fashioned average: add all of the values up, and then divide by the total number of values. The first five AFL margins were 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32, so the mean of these observations is just:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{56 + 31 + 56 + 8 + 32}{5} = \\frac{183}{5} = 36.60$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, this definition of the mean isn't news to anyone: averages (i.e., means) are used so often in everyday life that this is pretty familiar stuff. However, since the concept of a mean is something that everyone already understands, I'll use this as an excuse to start introducing some of the mathematical notation that statisticians use to describe this calculation, and talk about how the calculations would be done in Python. \n",
    "\n",

That is, we'll use $X_1$ to refer to the first observation, $X_2$ to refer to the second observation, and so on, all the way up to $X_N$ for the last one. Or, to say the same thing in a slightly more abstract way, we use $X_i$ to refer to the $i$-th observation.

It says Australia's house price to household income ratio of 5.6 in the major cities, and 4.3 nationwide, is comparable to many other developed nations. It says San Francisco and New York have ratios of 7, Auckland's is 6.7, and Vancouver comes in at 9.3.\n",

The median is the mid-point, effectively cutting out the highs and lows, and that means the average is generally higher when it comes to incomes and asset prices, because it includes the earnings of Australia's wealthiest people. To put it another way: the Commonwealth Bank's figures count Ralph Norris' multi-million dollar pay packet on the income side, but not his (no doubt) very expensive house in the property price figures, thus understating the house price to income ratio for middle-income Australians.\n",

It's probably an **_outlier_**, a value that doesn't really belong with the others. You might consider removing it from the data set entirely, and in this particular case I'd probably agree with that course of action. In real life, however, you don't always get such cut-and-dried examples. For instance, you might get this instead: \n",

    "When faced with a situation where some of the most extreme-valued observations might not be quite trustworthy, the mean is not necessarily a good measure of central tendency. It is highly sensitive to one or two extreme values, and is thus not considered to be a **_robust_** measure. One remedy that we've seen is to use the median. A more general solution is to use a \"trimmed mean\".  To calculate a trimmed mean, what you do is \"discard\" the most extreme examples on both ends (i.e., the largest and the smallest), and then take the mean of everything else. The goal is to preserve the best characteristics of the mean and the median: just like a median, you aren't highly influenced by extreme outliers, but like the mean, you \"use\" more than one of the observations. Generally, we describe a trimmed mean in terms of the percentage of observation on either side that are discarded. So, for instance, a 10% trimmed mean discards the largest 10% of the observations *and* the smallest 10% of the observations, and then takes the mean of the remaining 80% of the observations. Not surprisingly, the 0% trimmed mean is just the regular mean, and the 50% trimmed mean is the median. In that sense, trimmed means provide a whole family of central tendency measures that span the range from the mean to the median.\n",

This variable is clearly ratio scale (if it's not clear to you, it may help to re-read [](scales)), and so in most situations the mean or the median is the measure of central tendency that you want. But consider this scenario... a friend of yours is offering a bet. They pick a football game at random, and (without knowing who is playing) you have to guess the *exact* margin. If you guess correctly, you win \\$50. If you don't, you lose \\$1. There are no consolation prizes for \"almost\" getting the right answer. You have to guess exactly the right margin.

What do we mean by \"typical\" deviation? Usually, the mean or median value of these deviations! In practice, this leads to two different measures, the \"mean absolute deviation (from the mean)\" and the \"median absolute deviation (from the median)\". From what I've read, the measure based on the median seems to be used in statistics, and does seem to be the better of the two, but to be honest I don't think I've seen it used much in psychology.

Let's think about our AFL winning margins data, and once again we'll start by pretending that there's only 5 games in total, with winning margins of 56, 31, 56, 8 and 32. Since our calculations rely on an examination of the deviation from some reference point (in this case the mean), the first thing we need to calculate is the mean, $\\bar{X}$. For these five observations, our mean is $\\bar{X} = 36.6$. The next step is to convert each of our observations $X_i$ into a deviation score. We do this by calculating the difference between the observation $X_i$ and the mean $\\bar{X}$. That is, the deviation score is defined to be $X_i - \\bar{X}$. For the first observation in our sample, this is equal to $56 - 36.6 = 19.4$. Okay, that's simple enough. The next step in the process is to convert these deviations to absolute deviations. We do this by converting any negative values to positive ones. Mathematically, we would denote the absolute value of $-3$ as $|-3|$, and so we say that $|-3| = 3$. We use the absolute value function here because we don't really care whether the value is higher than the mean or lower than the mean, we're just interested in how *close* it is to the mean.

From a purely mathematical perspective, there are some solid reasons to prefer squared deviations rather than absolute deviations. If we do that, we obtain a measure is called the **_variance_**, which has a lot of really nice statistical properties that I'm going to ignore, [^note8] and one massive psychological flaw that I'm going to make a big deal out of in a moment. The variance of a data set $X$ is sometimes written as $\\mbox{Var}(X)$ but it's more commonly denoted $s^2$ (the reason for this will become clearer shortly). The formula that we use to calculate the variance of a set of observations is as follows:\n",

What Python is doing is evaluating a slightly different formula to the one I showed you above. Instead of averaging the squared deviations, which requires you to divide by the number of data points $N$, Python has chosen to divide by $N-1$.

    "So that's the *what*. The real question is *why* Python is dividing by $N-1$ and not by $N$. After all, the variance is supposed to be the *mean* squared deviation, right? So shouldn't we be dividing by $N$, the actual number of observations in the sample? Well, yes, we should. However, as we'll discuss in the section on [estimation](estimation), there's a subtle distinction between \"describing a sample\" and \"making guesses about the population from which the sample came\". Up to this point, it's been a distinction without a difference. Regardless of whether you're describing a sample or drawing inferences about the population, the mean is calculated exactly the same way. Not so for the variance, or the standard deviation, or for many other measures besides. What I outlined to you initially (i.e., take the actual average, and thus dividing by $N$) assumes that you literally intend to calculate the variance of the sample. Most of the time, however, you're not terribly interested in the sample *in and of itself*. Rather, the sample exists to tell you something about the world. If so, you're actually starting to move away from calculating a \"sample statistic\", and towards the idea of estimating a \"population parameter\". However, I'm getting ahead of myself. For now, let's just take it on faith that Python knows what it's doing, and we'll revisit the question later on when we talk about [estimation](estimation). \n",

    "Okay, one last thing. This section so far has read a bit like a mystery novel. I've shown you how to calculate the variance, described the weird \"$N-1$\" thing that Python does and hinted at the reason why it's there, but I haven't mentioned the single most important thing... how do you *interpret* the variance? Descriptive statistics are supposed to describe things, after all, and right now the variance is really just a gibberish number. Unfortunately, the reason why I haven't given you the human-friendly interpretation of the variance is that there really isn't one. This is the most serious problem with the variance. Although it has some elegant mathematical properties that suggest that it really is a fundamental quantity for expressing variation, it's completely useless if you want to communicate with an actual human... variances are completely uninterpretable in terms of the original variable! All the numbers have been squared, and they don't mean anything anymore. This is a huge issue. For instance, according to the table I presented earlier, the margin in game 1 was \"376.36 points-squared higher than the average margin\". This is *exactly* as stupid as it sounds; and so when we calculate a variance of 324.64, we're in the same situation. I've watched a lot of footy games, and never has anyone referred to \"points squared\". It's *not* a real unit of measurement, and since the variance is expressed in terms of this gibberish unit, it is totally meaningless to a human.\n",

What should you do? The solution to the problem is obvious: take the square root of the variance, known as the **_standard deviation_**, also called the \"root mean squared deviation\", or RMSD. This solves our problem fairly neatly: while nobody has a clue what \"a variance of 324.68 points-squared\" really means, it's much easier to understand \"a standard deviation of 18.01 points\", since it's expressed in the original units. It is traditional to refer to the standard deviation of a sample of data as $s$, though \t\"sd\" and \"std dev.\" are also used at times.

Because the standard deviation is derived from the variance, and the variance is a quantity that has little to no meaning that makes sense to us humans, the standard deviation doesn't have a simple interpretation.

Instead, what happens a lot is that the researcher *actually* wants to calculate the standard deviation. However, in the same way that the mean is very sensitive to extreme values, the standard deviation is vulnerable to the exact same issue. So, in much the same way that people sometimes use the median as a \"robust\" way of calculating \"something that is like the mean\", it's not uncommon to use MAD as a method for calculating \"something that is like the standard deviation\". Unfortunately, the *raw* MAD value doesn't do this. Our raw MAD value is 19.5, and our standard deviation was 26.07. However, what some clever person has shown is that, under certain assumptions (the assumption again being that the data are normally-distributed!), you can multiply the raw MAD value by 1.4826 and obtain a number that is directly comparable to the standard deviation.

    "- [*Variance*](var). Tells you the average squared deviation from the mean. It's mathematically elegant, and is probably the \"right\" way to describe variation around the mean, but it's completely uninterpretable because it doesn't use the same units as the data. Almost never used except as a mathematical tool; but it's buried \"under the hood\" of a very large number of statistical tools.\n",
    "- [*Standard deviation*](sd). This is the square root of the variance. It's fairly elegant mathematically, and it's expressed in the same units as the data so it can be interpreted pretty well. In situations where the mean is the measure of central tendency, this is the default. This is by far the most popular measure of variation. \n",

Not used very often, but it does get reported sometimes.\n",

    "Suppose my friend is putting together a new questionnaire intended to measure \"grumpiness\". The survey has 50 questions, which you can answer in a grumpy way or not. Across a big sample (hypothetically, let's imagine a million people or so!) the data are fairly normally distributed, with the mean grumpiness score being 17 out of 50 questions answered in a grumpy way, and the standard deviation is 5. In contrast, when I take the questionnaire, I answer 35 out of 50 questions in a grumpy way. So, how grumpy am I? One way to think about it would be to say that I have grumpiness of 35/50, so you might say that I'm 70% grumpy. But that's a bit weird, when you think about it. If my friend had phrased her questions a bit differently, people might have answered them in a different way, so the overall distribution of answers could easily move up or down depending on the precise way in which the questions were asked. So, I'm only 70% grumpy *with respect to this set of survey questions*. Even if it's a very good questionnaire, this isn't very a informative statement. \n",

Shockingly, out of my friend's sample of 1,000,000 people, only 159 people were as grumpy as me (that's not at all unrealistic, frankly), suggesting that I'm in the top 0.016% of people for grumpiness. This makes much more sense than trying to interpret the raw data. This idea -- that we should describe my grumpiness in terms of the overall distribution of the grumpiness of humans -- is the qualitative idea that standardisation attempts to get at. One way to do this is to do exactly what I just did, and describe everything in terms of percentiles. However, the problem with doing this is that \"it's lonely at the top\". Suppose that my friend had only collected a sample of 1000 people (still a pretty big sample for the purposes of testing a new questionnaire, I'd like to add), and this time gotten a mean of 16 out of 50 with a standard deviation of 5, let's say. The problem is that almost certainly, not a single person in that sample would be as grumpy as me.\n",

Standard scores can be compared to one another in situations where the raw scores can't. Suppose, for instance, my friend also had another questionnaire that measured extraversion using a 24 items questionnaire. The overall mean for this measure turns out to be 13 with standard deviation 4, and I scored a 2. As you can imagine, it doesn't make a lot of sense to try to compare my raw score of 2 on the extraversion questionnaire to my raw score of 35 on the grumpiness questionnaire. The raw scores for the two variables are \"about\" fundamentally different things, so this would be like comparing apples to oranges.\n",

These two numbers *can* be compared to each other. [^note11]  I'm much less extraverted than most people ($z = -2.75$) and much grumpier than most people ($z = 3.6$): but the extent of my unusualness is much more extreme for grumpiness (since 3.6 is a bigger number than 2.75).  Because each standardised score is a statement about where an observation falls *relative to its own population*, it *is* possible to compare standardised scores across completely different variables. \n",

The correlation coefficient between two variables $X$ and $Y$ (sometimes denoted $r_{XY}$), which we'll define more precisely in the next section, is a measure that varies from $-1$ to $1$. When $r = -1$ it means that we have a perfect negative relationship, and when $r = 1$ it means we have a perfect positive relationship. When $r = 0$, there's no relationship at all.

    "The formula for the Pearson's correlation coefficient can be written in several different ways. I think the simplest way to write down the formula is to break it into two steps. Firstly, let's introduce the idea of a **_covariance_**. The covariance between two variables $X$ and $Y$ is a generalisation of the notion of the variance; it's a mathematically simple way of describing the relationship between two variables that isn't terribly informative to humans:\n",

    "$$\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we're multiplying (i.e., taking the \"product\" of) a quantity that depends on $X$ by a quantity that depends on $Y$ and then averaging [^note_covariance], you can think of the formula for the covariance as an \"average cross product\" between $X$ and $Y$. The covariance has the nice property that, if $X$ and $Y$ are entirely unrelated, then the covariance is exactly zero. If the relationship between them is positive (in the sense shown in {numref}`fig-corrs` then the covariance is also positive; and if the relationship is negative then the covariance is also negative. In other words, the covariance captures the basic qualitative idea of correlation. Unfortunately, the raw magnitude of the covariance isn't easy to interpret: it depends on the units in which $X$ and $Y$ are expressed, and worse yet, the actual units that the covariance itself is expressed in are really weird. For instance, if $X$ refers to the `dan_sleep` variable (units: hours) and $Y$ refers to the `dan_grump` variable (units: grumps), then the units for their covariance are \"hours $\\times$ grumps\". And I have no freaking idea what that would even mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Pearson correlation coefficient $r$ fixes this interpretation problem by standardising the covariance, in pretty much the exact same way that the $z$-score standardises a raw score: by dividing by the standard deviation. However, because we have two variables that contribute to the covariance, the standardisation only works if we divide by both standard deviations (this is an oversimplification, but it'll do for our purposes)  In other words, the correlation between $X$ and $Y$ can be written as follows:\n",

I'll expand a little more on this point later, in section on [interpreting correlations](interpreting-correlations). But before I do, let's look at how to calculate correlations in Python.\n",

    "Naturally, in real life you don't see many correlations of 1. So how should you interpret a correlation of, say $r= .4$? The honest answer is that it really depends on what you want to use the data for, and on how strong the correlations in your field tend to be. A  friend of mine in engineering once argued that any correlation less than $.95$ is completely useless (I think he was exaggerating, even for engineering). On the other hand there are real cases -- even in psychology -- where you should really expect correlations that strong. For instance, one of the benchmark data sets used to test theories of how people judge similarities is so clean that any theory that can't achieve a correlation of at least $.9$ really isn't deemed to be successful. However, when looking for (say) elementary correlates of intelligence (e.g., inspection time, response time), if you get a correlation above $.3$ you're doing very very well. In short, the interpretation of a correlation depends a lot on the context. That said, the rough guide in {numref}`table-corr-interpretation` is pretty typical."

Often, this is a pretty good approximation to what we mean when we say \"relationship\", and so the Pearson correlation is a good thing to calculation. Sometimes, it isn't. \n",
    "\n",
    "One very common situation where the Pearson correlation isn't quite the right thing to use arises when an increase in one variable $X$ really is reflected in an increase in another variable $Y$, but the nature of the relationship isn't necessarily linear. An example of this might be the relationship between effort and reward when studying for an exam. If you put in zero effort ($X$) into learning a subject, then you should expect a grade of 0% ($Y$). However, a little bit of effort will cause a *massive* improvement: just turning up to lectures means that you learn a fair bit, and if you just turn up to classes, and scribble a few things down so your grade might rise to 35%, all without a lot of effort. However, you just don't get the same effect at the other end of the scale. As everyone knows, it takes *a lot* more effort to get a grade of 90% than it takes to get a grade of 55%. What this means is that, if I've got data looking at study effort and grades, there's a pretty good chance that Pearson correlations will be misleading. \n",

That is, student 1 did the least work out of anyone (2 hours) so they get the lowest rank (rank = 1). Student 4 was the next laziest, putting in only  6 hours of work in over the whole semester, so they get the next lowest rank (rank = 2). Notice that I'm using \"rank = 1\" to mean \"low rank\". Sometimes in everyday language we talk about \"rank = 1\" to mean \"top rank\" rather than \"bottom rank\". So be careful: you can rank \"from smallest value to largest value\" (i.e., small equals rank 1) or you can rank \"from largest value to smallest value\" (i.e., large equals rank 1). In this case, I'm ranking from smallest to largest, because that is how Python does it.

Why not? Well, remember that although `nan` stands for \"not a number\", the more accurate interpretation of `nan` here is \"There should be a number here, but I don't know what that number is\". This means that `1 + nan = nan`: if I add 1 to some number that I don't know (i.e., the `nan`) then the answer is *also* a number that I don't know. As a consequence, if you don't explicitly tell Python to ignore the `nan` values, and the data set does have missing values, then the output will itself be a missing value.

    "This actually looks pretty good! We *know* there are `nan`s in the data, but `pandas` seems to deal with them handily. This is not untrue, but there is a small but important detail to be aware of. When it encounters data with `nan`s, `pandas` only looks at the pair of variables that it's trying to correlate when determining what to drop. So, for instance, since the only missing value for observation 1 of `parenthood2` is for `baby_sleep`, Python will only drop observation 1 when `baby_sleep` is one of the variables involved, and keeps observation 1 when trying to correlate e.g. `dan.sleep` and `dan_grump`. If we want to simply ignore *all* rows that contain a `nan`, we need to tell `pandas` to drop them, like this:"

    "The results from `parenthood2.corr()` and `parenthood2.dropna().corr()` are similar, but not quite the same. The two approaches have different strengths and weaknesses. The \"pairwise\" approach, the one in which Python only drops observations when they are involved in the comparison at hand, has the advantage that it keeps more observations, so you're making use of more of your data and (as we'll discuss in tedious detail in the chapter on [estimation](estimation)) this improves the reliability of your estimated correlation. On the other hand, it means that every correlation in your correlation matrix is being computed from a slightly different set of observations, which can be awkward when you want to compare the different correlations that you've got. \n",
    " \n",
    "So which method should you use? It depends a lot on *why* you think your values are missing, and probably depends a little on how paranoid you are. For instance, if you think that the missing values were \"chosen\" completely randomly [^note15] then you'll probably want to use the pairwise method. If you think that missing data are a cue to thinking that the whole observation might be rubbish (e.g., someone just selecting arbitrary responses in your questionnaire), but that there's no pattern to which observations are \"rubbish\", then it's probably safer to keep only those observations that are complete. If you think there's something systematic going on, in that some observations are more likely to be missing than others, then you have a much trickier problem to solve, and one that is beyond the scope of this book.\n",

    "Calculating some basic descriptive statistics is one of the very first things you do when analysing real data, and descriptive statistics are much simpler to understand than inferential statistics, so like every other statistics textbook I've started with descriptives. In this chapter, we talked about the following topics:\n",

    "\n",
    "- [*Measures of central tendency*](central-tendency). Broadly speaking, central tendency measures tell you where the data are. There's three measures that are typically reported in the literature: the mean, median and mode.\n",
    "- [*Measures of variability*](variability). In contrast, measures of variability tell you about how \"spread out\" the data are. The key measures are: range, standard deviation, interquartile reange \n",
    "- [*Standard scores*](zcores). The $z$-score is a slightly unusual beast. It's not quite a descriptive statistic, and not quite an inference. Make sure you understood this section: it'll come up again later. \n",
    "- [*Correlations*](correlations). Want to know how strong the relationship is between two variables? Calculate a correlation.\n",
    "- [*Missing data*](missing). Dealing with missing data is one of those frustrating things that data analysts really wish the didn't have to think about. In real life it can be hard to do well. For the purpose of this book, we only touched on the basics in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next section we'll move on to a discussion of how to draw pictures! Everyone loves a pretty picture, right? But before we do, I want to end on an important point. A traditional first course in statistics spends only a small proportion of the class on descriptive statistics, maybe one or two lectures at most. The vast majority of the lecturer's time is spent on inferential statistics, because that's where all the hard stuff is. That makes sense, but it hides the practical everyday importance of choosing good descriptives. With that in mind..."

    "Stalin's infamous quote about the statistical character death of millions is worth giving some thought. The clear intent of his statement is that the death of an individual touches us personally and its force cannot be denied, but that the deaths of a multitude are incomprehensible, and as a consequence mere statistics, more easily ignored. I'd argue that Stalin was half right. A statistic is an abstraction, a description of events beyond our personal experience, and so hard to visualise. Few if any of us can imagine what the deaths of millions is \"really\" like, but we can imagine one death, and this gives the lone death its feeling of immediate tragedy, a feeling that is missing from Ellman's cold statistical description.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet it is not so simple: without numbers, without counts, without a description of what happened, we have *no chance* of understanding what really happened, no opportunity event to try to summon the missing feeling. And in truth, as I write this, sitting in comfort on a Saturday morning, half a world and a whole lifetime away from the Gulags, when I put the Ellman estimate next to the Stalin quote a dull dread settles in my stomach and a chill settles over me. The Stalinist repression is something truly beyond my experience, but with a combination of statistical data and those recorded personal histories that have come down to us, it is not entirely beyond my comprehension. Because what Ellman's numbers tell us is this: over a two year period, Stalinist repression wiped out the equivalent of every man, woman and child currently alive in the city where I live. Each one of those deaths had it's own story, was it's own tragedy, and only some of those are known to us now. Even so, with a few carefully chosen statistics, the scale of the atrocity starts to come into focus.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus it is no small thing to say that the first task of the statistician and the scientist is to summarise the data, to find some collection of numbers that can convey to an audience a sense of what has happened. This is the job of descriptive statistics, but it's not a job that can be told solely using the numbers. You are a data analyst, not a statistical software package. Part of your job is to take these *statistics* and turn them into a *description*. When you analyse data, it is not sufficient to list off a collection of numbers. Always remember that what you're really trying to do is communicate with a human audience. The numbers are important, but they need to be put together into a meaningful story that your audience can interpret. That means you need to think about framing. You need to think about context. And you need to think about the individual events that your statistics are summarising. "
