    "Over the course of the last few chapters you can probably detect a general trend. We started out looking at tools that you can use to compare two groups to one another, most notably the [$t$-test](ttest). Then, we introduced [analysis of variance](anova) (ANOVA) as a method for comparing more than two groups. The chapter on [regression](regression) covered a somewhat different topic, but in doing so it introduced a powerful new idea: building statistical models that have *multiple* predictor variables used to explain a single outcome variable. For instance, a regression model could be used to predict the number of errors a student makes in a reading comprehension test based on the number of hours they studied for the test, and their score on a standardised IQ test. The goal in this chapter is to import this idea into the ANOVA framework. For instance, suppose we were interested in using the reading comprehension test to measure student achievements in three different schools, and we suspect that girls and boys are developing at different rates (and so would be expected to have different performance on average). Each student is classified in two different ways: on the basis of their gender, and on the basis of their school. What we'd like to do is analyse the reading comprehension scores in terms of *both* of these grouping variables. The tool for doing so is generically referred to as **_factorial ANOVA_**. However, since we have two grouping variables, we sometimes refer to the analysis as a two-way ANOVA, in contrast to the one-way ANOVAs that we [ran earlier](anova)."

    "When we discussed [analysis of variance](anova), we assumed a fairly simple experimental design: each person falls into one of several groups, and we want to know whether these groups have different means on some outcome variable. In this section, I'll discuss a broader class of experimental designs, known as **_factorial designs_**, in we have more than one grouping variable. I gave one example of how this kind of design might arise above. Another example appears in the chapter on [ANOVA](anova), in which we were looking at the effect of different drugs on the `mood_gain` experienced by each person. In that chapter we did find a significant effect of drug, but at the end of the chapter we also ran an analysis to see if there was an effect of therapy. We didn't find one, but there's something a bit worrying about trying to run two *separate* analyses trying to predict the same outcome. Maybe there actually *is* an effect of therapy on mood gain, but we couldn't find it because it was being \"hidden\" by the effect of drug? In other words, we're going to want to run a *single* analysis that includes *both* `drug` and `therapy` as predictors. For this analysis each person is cross-classified by the drug they were given (a factor with 3 levels) and what therapy they received (a factor with 2 levels). We refer to this as a $3 \\times 2$ factorial design. If we cross-tabulate `drug` by `therapy` using the `crosstab()` in `pandas`, we get the following table:"

    "Like one-way ANOVA, factorial ANOVA is a tool for testing certain types of hypotheses about population means. So a sensible place to start would be to be explicit about what our hypotheses actually are. However, before we can even get to that point, it's really useful to have some clean and simple notation to describe the population means. Because of the fact that observations are cross-classified in terms of two different factors, there are quite a lot of different means that one might be interested. To see this, let's start by thinking about all the different sample means that we can calculate for this kind of design. Firstly, there's the obvious idea that we might be interested in this table of group means:"

    "Okay, what about the remaining entries? For instance, how should we describe the average mood gain across the entire (hypothetical) population of people who might be given Joyzepam in an experiment like this, regardless of whether they were in CBT? We use the \"dot\" notation to express this. In the case of Joyzepam, notice that we're talking about the mean associated with the third row in the table. That is, we're averaging across two cell means (i.e., $\\mu_{31}$ and $\\mu_{32}$). The result of this averaging is referred to as a **_marginal mean_**, and would be denoted $\\mu_{3.}$ in this case. The marginal mean for CBT corresponds to the population mean associated with the second column in the table, so we use the notation $\\mu_{.2}$ to describe it. The grand mean is denoted $\\mu_{..}$ because it is the mean obtained by averaging (marginalising[^notemarginalising]) over both. So our full table of population means can be written down like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "[^notemarginalising]: Technically, marginalising isn't quite identical to a regular mean: it's a weighted average, where you take into account the frequency of the different events that you're averaging over. However, in a balanced design, all of our cell frequencies are equal by definition, so the two are equivalent. We'll discuss unbalanced designs later, and when we do so you'll see that all of our calculations become a real headache. But let's ignore this for now."

    "Now that we have this notation, it is straightforward to formulate and express some hypotheses. Let's suppose that the goal is to find out two things: firstly, does the choice of drug have any effect on mood, and secondly, does CBT have any effect on mood? These aren't the only hypotheses that we could formulate of course, and we'll see a really important example of a different kind of hypothesis in the section on [interactions](interactions), but these are the two simplest hypotheses to test, and so we'll start there. Consider the first test. If drug has no effect, then we would expect all of the row means to be identical, right? So that's our null hypothesis. On the other hand, if the drug does matter then we should expect these row means to be different. Formally, we write down our null and alternative hypotheses in terms of the *equality of marginal means*:"

    "regardless of whether we're talking about `drug`, `therapy` or the residuals. To see this, let's not worry about how the sums of squares values are calculated: instead, let's take it on faith that Python has calculated the SS values correctly, and try to verify that all the rest of the numbers make sense. First, note that for the `drug` factor, we divide $3.45$ by $2$, and end up with a mean square value of $1.73$. For the `therapy` factor, there's only 1 degree of freedom, so our calculations are even simpler: dividing $0.47$ (the SS value) by 1 gives us an answer of $0.47$ (the MS value). \n",

    "Turning to the $F$ statistics and the $p$ values, notice that we have two of each: one corresponding to the `drug` factor and the other corresponding to the `therapy` factor. Regardless of which one we're talking about, the $F$ statistic is calculated by dividing the mean square value associated with the factor by the mean square value associated with the residuals. If we use \"A\" as shorthand notation to refer to the first factor (factor A; in this case `drug`) and \"R\" as shorthand notation to refer to the residuals, then the $F$ statistic associated with factor A is denoted $F_A$, and is calculated as follows:\n",

Anyway, to apply this formula to the  `drugs` factor, we take the mean square of $1.73$ and divide it by the residual mean square value of $0.07$, which gives us an $F$-statistic of $26.15$. The corresponding calculation for the `therapy` variable would be to divide $0.47$ by $0.07$ which gives $7.08$ as the $F$-statistic. Not surprisingly, of course, these are the same values that R has reported in the ANOVA table above.\n",

    "The last part of the ANOVA table is the calculation of the $p$ values. Once again, there is nothing new here: for each of our two factors, what we're trying to do is test the null hypothesis that there is no relationship between the factor and the outcome variable (I'll be a bit more precise about this later on). To that end, we've (apparently) followed a similar strategy that we did in the one way ANOVA, and have calculated an $F$-statistic for each of these hypotheses. To convert these to $p$ values, all we need to do is note that the  that the sampling distribution for the $F$ *statistic* under the null hypothesis (that the factor in question is irrelevant) is an $F$ *distribution*: and that two degrees of freedom values are those corresponding to the factor, and those corresponding to the residuals. For the `drug` factor we're talking about an $F$ distribution with 2 and 14 degrees of freedom (I'll discuss degrees of freedom in more detail later). In contrast, for the `therapy` factor sampling distribution is $F$ with 1 and 14 degrees of freedom."

    "At this point, I hope you can see that the ANOVA table for this more complicated analysis corresponding to `model2` should be read in much the same way as the ANOVA table for the simpler analysis for `model1`. In short, it's telling us that the factorial ANOVA for our $3 \\times 2$ design found a significant effect of drug ($F_{2,12} = 31.71, p < .001$) as well as a significant effect of therapy ($F_{1,12} = 8.58, p = .01$). Or, to use the more technically correct terminology, we would say that there are two **_main effects_** of drug and therapy. Why are these \"main\" effects?

The only difference is that we add to the number of predictors in the `between` argument of `pingouin`'s `anova()` function. Secondly, I wanted to show you what the ANOVA table looks like in this case, so that you can see from the outset that the basic logic and structure behind factorial ANOVA is the same as that which underpins one way ANOVA. Try to hold onto that feeling. It's genuinely true, insofar as factorial ANOVA is built in more or less the same way as the simpler one-way ANOVA model. It's just that this feeling of familiarity starts to evaporate once you start digging into the details. Traditionally, this comforting sensation is replaced by an urge to murder the the authors of statistics textbooks.\n",

The explanation that I gave in the last section illustrates the fact that the hypothesis tests for the main effects (of drug and therapy in this case) are $F$-tests, but what it doesn't do is show you how the sum of squares (SS) values are calculated. Nor does it tell you explicitly how to calculate degrees of freedom ($df$ values) though that's a simple thing by comparison. Let's assume for now that we have only two predictor variables, Factor A and Factor B. If we use $Y$ to refer to the outcome variable, then we would use $Y_{rci}$ to refer to the outcome associated with the $i$-th member of group $rc$ (i.e., level/row $r$ for Factor A and level/column $c$ for Factor B). Thus, if we use $\\bar{Y}$ to refer to a sample mean, we can use the same notation as before to refer to group means, marginal means and grand means: that is, $\\bar{Y}_{rc}$ is the sample mean associated with the $r$th level of Factor A and the $c$th level of Factor B, $\\bar{Y}_{r.}$ would be the marginal mean for the $r$th level of Factor A, $\\bar{Y}_{.c}$ would be the marginal mean for the $c$th level of Factor B, and $\\bar{Y}_{..}$ is the grand mean. In other words, our sample means can be organised into the same table as the population means. For our clinical trial data, that table looks like this:"

    "As with one-way ANOVA, the most interesting [^translation] part of this formula is the $\\left( \\bar{Y}_{r.} - \\bar{Y}_{..} \\right)^2$ bit, which corresponds to the squared deviation associated with level $r$. All that this formula does is calculate this squared deviation for all $R$ levels of the factor, add them up, and then multiply the result by $N \\times C$. The reason for this last part is that there are multiple cells in our design that have level $r$ on Factor A: in fact, there are $C$ of them, one corresponding to each possible level of Factor B! For instance, in our toy example, there are *two* different cells in the design corresponding to the `anxifree` drug: one for people with `no.therapy`, and one for the `CBT` group. Not only that, within each of these cells there are $N$ observations. So, if we want to convert our SS value into a quantity that calculates the between-groups sum of squares on a \"per observation\" basis, we have to multiply by by $N \\times C$.

    "So that's how you calculate the SS values for the two main effects. These SS values are analogous to the between-group sum of squares values that we calculated when doing [one-way ANOVA](anova). However, it's not a good idea to think of them as between-groups SS values anymore, just because we have two different grouping variables and it's easy to get confused. In order to construct an $F$ test, however, we also need to calculate the within-groups sum of squares. In keeping with the terminology that we used in the [regression chapter](regression)) and the terminology that R uses when printing out the ANOVA table, I'll start referring to the within-groups SS value as the *residual* sum of squares SS$_R$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to think about the residual SS values in this context, I think, is to think of it as the leftover variation in the outcome variable after you take into account the differences in the marginal means (i.e., after you remove SS$_A$ and SS$_B$). What I mean by that is we can start by calculating the total sum of squares, which I'll label SS$_T$. The formula for this is pretty much the same as it was for one-way ANOVA: we take the difference between each observation $Y_{rci}$ and the grand mean $\\bar{Y}_{..}$, square the differences, and add them all up\n",

In the first two summations, we're summing across all levels of Factor A (i.e., over all possible rows $r$ in our table), across all levels of Factor B (i.e., all possible columns $c$). Each $rc$ combination corresponds to a single group, and each group contains $N$ people: so we have to sum across all those people (i.e., all $i$ values) too. In other words, all we're doing here is summing across all observations in the data set (i.e., all possible $rci$ combinations). \n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, we know the total variability of the outcome variable SS$_T$, and we know how much of that variability can be attributed to Factor A (SS$_A$) and how much of it can be attributed to Factor B (SS$_B$). The residual sum of squares is thus defined to be the variability in $Y$ that *can't* be attributed to either of our two factors. In other words:\n",

    "Of course, there is a formula that you can use to calculate the residual SS directly, but I think that it makes more conceptual sense to think of it like this. The whole point of calling it a residual is that it's the leftover variation, and the formula above makes that clear. I should also note that, in keeping with the terminology used in the regression chapter, it is commonplace to refer to $\\mbox{SS}_A + \\mbox{SS}_B$ as the variance attributable to the \"ANOVA model\", denoted SS$_M$, and so we often say that the total sum of squares is equal to the model sum of squares plus the residual sum of squares. Later on in this chapter we'll see that this isn't just a surface similarity: ANOVA and regression are actually the same thing under the hood. \n",

    "In any case, it's probably worth taking a moment to check that we can calculate SS$_R$ using this formula, and verify that we do obtain the same answer that `pingouin` produces in its ANOVA table. The calculations are pretty straightforward. First we calculate the total sum of squares:"

    "The degrees of freedom are calculated in much the same way as for one-way ANOVA. For any given factor, the degrees of freedom is equal to the number of levels minus 1 (i.e., $R-1$ for the row variable, Factor A, and $C-1$ for the column variable, Factor B). So, for the `drugs` factor we obtain $df = 2$, and for the `therapy` factor we obtain $df=1$. Later on on, when we discuss the interpretation of [ANOVA as a regression model](anovalm)), I'll give a clearer statement of how we arrive at this number, but for the moment we can use the simple definition of degrees of freedom, namely that the degrees of freedom equals the number of quantities that are observed, minus the number of constraints. So, for the `drugs` factor, we observe 3 separate group means, but these are constrained by 1 grand mean; and therefore the degrees of freedom is 2. For the residuals, the logic is similar, but not quite the same. The total number of observations in our experiment is 18. The constraints correspond to the 1 grand mean, the 2 additional group means that the `drug` factor introduces, and the 1 additional group mean that the the `therapy` factor introduces, and so our degrees of freedom is 14. As a formula, this is $N-1 -(R-1)-(C-1)$, which simplifies to $N-R-C+1$."

    "### Factorial ANOVA versus one-way ANOVAs\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've seen *how* a factorial ANOVA works, it's worth taking a moment to compare it to the results of the one way analyses, because this will give us a really good sense of *why* it's a good idea to run the factorial ANOVA. In the [chapter on 1-way ANOVA](anova), I ran a one-way ANOVA that looked to see if there are any differences between drugs, and a second one-way ANOVA to see if there were any differences between therapies. As we saw in [previously](factanovahyp), the null and alternative hypotheses tested by the one-way ANOVAs are in fact identical to the hypotheses tested by the factorial ANOVA. Looking even more carefully at the ANOVA tables, we can see that the sum of squares associated with the factors are identical in the two different analyses (3.45 for `drug` and 0.92 for `therapy`), as are the degrees of freedom (2 for `drug`, 1 for `therapy`). But they don't give the same answers! Most notably, when we ran the [one-way ANOVA for `therapy`](anovaandt) we didn't find a significant effect (the $p$-value was 0.21). However, when we look at the main effect of `therapy` within the context of the two-way ANOVA, we do get a significant effect ($p=.019$). The two analyses are clearly not the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does that happen? The answer lies in understanding how the *residuals* are calculated. Recall that the whole idea behind an $F$-test is to compare the variability that can be attributed to a particular factor with the variability that cannot be accounted for (the residuals). If you run a one-way ANOVA for `therapy`, and therefore ignore the effect of `drug`, the ANOVA will end up dumping all of the drug-induced variability into the residuals! This has the effect of making the data look more noisy than they really are, and the effect of `therapy` which is correctly found to be significant in the two-way ANOVA now becomes non-significant. If we ignore something that actually matters (e.g., `drug`) when trying to assess the contribution of something else (e.g., `therapy`) then our analysis will be distorted. Of course, it's perfectly okay to ignore variables that are genuinely irrelevant to the phenomenon of interest: if we had recorded the colour of the walls, and that turned out to be non-significant in a three-way ANOVA (i.e. `pg.anova(dv='mood_gain', between=['drug', 'therapy', 'wall_color']`), it would be perfectly okay to disregard it and just report the simpler two-way ANOVA that doesn't include this irrelevant factor. What you shouldn't do is drop variables that actually make a difference! "

Well, so far we have the ability to talk about the idea that drugs can influence mood, and therapy can influence mood, but no way of talking about the possibility of an **_interaction_** between the two. An interaction between A and B is said to occur whenever the effect of Factor A is *different*, depending on which level of Factor B we're talking about. Several examples of an interaction effect with the context of a 2 x 2 ANOVA are shown in {numref}`fig-anovas-avec-interaction`. To give a more concrete example, suppose that the operation of Anxifree and Joyzepam is governed quite different physiological mechanisms, and one consequence of this is that while Joyzepam has more or less the same effect on mood regardless of whether one is in therapy, Anxifree is actually much more effective when administered in conjunction with CBT. The ANOVA that we developed in the previous section does not capture this idea. To get some idea of whether an interaction is actually happening here, it helps to plot the various group means."

    "To give a more concrete example, suppose that the operation of Anxifree and Joyzepam is governed quite different physiological mechanisms, and one consequence of this is that while Joyzepam has more or less the same effect on mood regardless of whether one is in therapy, Anxifree is actually much more effective when administered in conjunction with CBT.

We can do this easily with `seaborn`:"

    "Our main concern relates to the fact that the two lines aren't parallel. The effect of CBT (difference between solid line and dotted line) when the drug is Joyzepam (right side) appears to be near zero, even smaller than the effect of CBT when a placebo is used (left side). However, when Anxifree is administered, the effect of CBT is larger than the placebo (middle). Is this effect real, or is this just random variation due to chance? Our original ANOVA cannot answer this question, because we make no allowances for the idea that interactions even exist! In this section, we'll fix this problem.\n",

    "Intuitively, the idea behind an interaction effect is fairly simple: it just means that the effect of Factor A is different, depending on which level of Factor B we're talking about. But what does that actually mean in terms of our data? {numref}`fig-anovas-avec-interaction` depicts several different patterns that, although quite different to each other, would all count as an interaction effect. So it's not entirely straightforward to translate this qualitative idea into something mathematical that a statistician can work with. As a consequence, the way that the idea of an interaction effect is formalised in terms of null and alternative hypotheses is slightly difficult, and I'm guessing that a lot of readers of this book probably won't be all that interested. Even so, I'll try to give the basic idea here.\n",

    "To start with, we need to be a little more explicit about our main effects. Consider the main effect of Factor A (`drug` in our running example). We originally formulated this in terms of the null hypothesis that the two marginal means $\\mu_{r.}$ are all equal to each other. Obviously, if all of these are equal to each other, then they must also be equal to the grand mean $\\mu_{..}$ as well, right? So what we can do is define the *effect* of Factor A at level $r$ to be equal to the difference between the marginal mean $\\mu_{r.}$ and the grand mean $\\mu_{..}$.  \n",

Of course, all of those formulas refer to population parameters rather than sample statistics, so we don't actually know what they are. However, we can estimate them by using sample means in place of population means. So for Factor A, a good way to estimate the main effect at level $r$ as the difference between the *sample* marginal mean $\\bar{Y}_{rc}$ and the sample grand mean $\\bar{Y}_{..}$. That is, we would use this as our estimate of the effect:\n",

The answer to this can be found by first rearranging the formula for the group means $\\mu_{rc}$ under the alternative hypothesis, so that we get this:\n",

For an $R \\times C$ factorial ANOVA, this means that there are $R \\times C$ quantities of interest in the model, and only the one constraint: all of the group means need to average out to the grand mean. So the model as a whole needs to have $(R\\times C) - 1$ degrees of freedom.

    "There's a couple of very important things to consider when interpreting the results of factorial ANOVA. Firstly, there's the same issue that we had with one-way ANOVA, which is that if you obtain a significant main effect of (say) `drug`, it doesn't tell you anything about which drugs are different to one another. To find that out, you need to run additional analyses. We'll talk about some analyses that you can run in the sections on [contrasts](contrasts) and [post-hoc tests](posthoc2). The same is true for interaction effects: knowing that there's a significant interaction doesn't tell you anything about what kind of interaction exists. Again, you'll need to run additional analyses. \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, there's a very peculiar interpretation issue that arises when you obtain a significant interaction effect but no corresponding main effect. This happens sometimes. For instance, in the crossover interaction shown in {numref}`fig-anovas-avec-interaction`), this is exactly what you'd find: in this case, neither of the main effects would be significant, but the interaction effect would be. This is a difficult situation to interpret, and people often get a bit confused about it. The general advice that statisticians like to give in this situation is that you shouldn't pay much attention to the main effects when an interaction is present. The reason they say this is that, although the tests of the main effects are perfectly valid from a mathematical point of view, when there is a significant interaction effect, the main effects rarely test interesting hypotheses. [Recall](factanovahyp) that the null hypothesis for a main effect is that the *marginal means* are equal to each other, and that a marginal mean is formed by averaging across several different groups. But if you have a significant interaction effect, then you *know* that the groups that comprise the marginal mean aren't homogeneous, so it's not really obvious why you would even care about those marginal means. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what I mean. Again, let's stick with a clinical example. Suppose that we had a $2 \\times 2$ design comparing two different treatments for phobias (e.g., systematic desensitisation vs flooding), and two different anxiety reducing drugs (e.g., Anxifree vs Joyzepam). Now suppose what we found was that Anxifree had no effect when desensitisation was the treatment, and Joyzepam had no effect when flooding was the treatment. But both were pretty effective for the other treatment. This is a classic crossover interaction, and what we'd find when running the ANOVA is that there is no main effect of drug, but a significant interaction. Now, what does it actually *mean* to say that there's no main effect? Well, it means that, if we average over the two different psychological treatments, then the *average* effect of Anxifree and Joyzepam is the same. But why would anyone care about that? When treating someone for phobias, it is never the case that a person can be treated using an \"average\" of flooding and desensitisation: that doesn't make a lot of sense. You either get one or the other. For one treatment, one drug is effective; and for the other treatment, the other drug is effective. The interaction is the important thing; the main effect is kind of irrelevant. \n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of thing happens a lot: the main effect are tests of marginal means, and when an interaction is present we often find ourselves not being terribly interested in marginal means, because they imply averaging over things that the interaction tells us shouldn't be averaged! Of course, it's not always the case that a main effect is meaningless when an interaction is present. Often you can get a big main effect and a very small interaction, in which case you can still say things like \"drug A is generally more effective than drug B\" (because there was a big effect of drug), but you'd need to modify it a bit by adding that \"the difference in effectiveness was different for different psychological treatments\". In any case, the main point here is that whenever you get a significant interaction you should stop and *think* about what the main effect actually means in this context. Don't automatically assume that the main effect is interesting. "

    "### Effect sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect size calculations for a factorial ANOVA is pretty similar to [those used in one way ANOVA](etasquared). Specifically, we can use $\\eta^2$ (eta-squared) as simple way to measure how big the overall effect is for any particular term. As before, $\\eta^2$ is defined by dividing the sum of squares associated with that term by the total sum of squares. For instance, to determine the size of the main effect of Factor A, we would use the following formula\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\eta_A^2 = \\frac{\\mbox{SS}_{A}}{\\mbox{SS}_{T}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As before, this can be interpreted in much the same way as $R^2$ in regression.[^R]  It tells you the proportion of variance in the outcome variable that can be accounted for by the main effect of Factor A. It is therefore a number that ranges from 0 (no effect at all) to 1 (accounts for *all* of the variability in the outcome). Moreover, the sum of all the $\\eta^2$ values, taken across all the terms in the model, will sum to the the total $R^2$ for the ANOVA model. If, for instance, the ANOVA model fits perfectly (i.e., there is no within-groups variability at all!), the $\\eta^2$ values will sum to 1. Of course, that rarely if ever happens in real life.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, when doing a factorial ANOVA, there is a second measure of effect size that people like to report, known as partial $\\eta^2$. This is the effect size measure that `pingouin` gives you by default. The idea behind partial $\\eta^2$ (which is sometimes denoted $_p\\eta^2$ or $\\eta^2_p$) is that, when measuring the effect size for a particular term (say, the main effect of Factor A), you want to deliberately ignore the other effects in the model (e.g., the main effect of Factor B). That is, you would pretend that the effect of all these other terms is zero, and then calculate what the $\\eta^2$ value would have been. This is actually pretty easy to calculate. All you have to do is remove the sum of squares associated with the other terms from the denominator. In other words, if you want the partial $\\eta^2$ for the main effect of Factor A, the denominator is just the sum of the SS values for Factor A and the residuals:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mbox{partial } \\eta^2_A = \\frac{\\mbox{SS}_{A}}{\\mbox{SS}_{A} + \\mbox{SS}_{R}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This will always give you a larger number than $\\eta^2$, which the cynic in me suspects accounts for the popularity of partial $\\eta^2$. And once again you get a number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents no effect. However, it's slightly trickier to interpret what a large partial $\\eta^2$ value means. In particular, you can't actually compare the partial $\\eta^2$ values across terms! Suppose, for instance, there is no within-groups variability at all: if so, SS$_R = 0$. What that means is that *every* term has a partial $\\eta^2$ value of 1. But that doesn't mean that all terms in your model are equally important, or indeed that they are equally large. All it mean is that all terms in your model have effect sizes that are large *relative to the residual variation*. It is not comparable across terms.\n",

    "[^R]: This chapter seems to be setting a new record for the number of different things that the letter R can stand for: so far we have R referring to the number of rows in our table of means, the residuals in the model, and now the correlation coefficient in a regression. Sorry: we clearly don't have enough letters in the alphabet. However, I've tried pretty hard to be clear on which thing R is referring to in each case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see what I mean by this, it's useful to see a concrete example. We can get `pingouin` to report $\\eta^2$ instead of partial $\\eta^2$ by specifying this in the `effsize` argument when we run our ANOVA:"

In contrast, because the effect of `drug` was very large, controlling for it makes a big difference, and so when we calculate the partial $\\eta^2$ for `therapy` you can see that it rises to $_p\\eta^2 = 0.336$. The question that we have to ask ourselves is, what do these partial $\\eta^2$ values actually *mean*? The way I generally interpret the partial $\\eta^2$ for the main effect of Factor A is to interpret it as a statement about a hypothetical experiment in which *only* Factor A was being varied. So, even though in *this* experiment we varied both A and B, we can easily imagine an experiment in which only Factor A was varied: the partial $\\eta^2$ statistic tells you how much of the variance in the outcome variable you would expect to see accounted for in that experiment. However, it should be noted that this interpretation -- like many things associated with main effects -- doesn't make a lot of sense when there is a large and significant interaction effect. "

The funny thing is, though, that while pacakges exist to perform a Levene test on factorial ANOVA models in e.g. R, I have not been able to find a package that does the same in Python. As of the date of writing this, I can only find examples of Levene's tests being performed on one-way models in Python. However, as far as I can tell, all that one needs to do is to create a new column in the dataframe that represents the interaction of the two factors, and run the Levene's test on that. This seems to give the same result as e.g. the R function `levene()` run on a two-way model with interactions, so I offer it here as my solution to this problem:\n",

Once we have done that, we can examine those residuals in a few different ways. It's generally a good idea to examine them graphically, by drawing histograms (i.e., `sns.histplot()` function) and QQ plots (i.e., `pg.qqplot()` function. If you want a formal test for the normality of the residuals, then we can run the Shapiro-Wilk test (i.e., `pg.normality()`).

In the context of ANOVA, I've been referring to the $F$-test as a way of testing whether a particular term in the model (e.g., main effect of Factor A) is significant. This interpretation is perfectly valid, but it's not necessarily the most useful way to think about the test. In fact, it's actually a fairly limiting way of thinking about what the $F$-test does. Consider the clinical trial data we've been working with in this chapter. Suppose I want to see if there are *any* effects of any kind that involve `therapy`. I'm not fussy: I don't care if it's a main effect or an interaction effect.[^imagine] One thing I could do is look at the output for `model2` earlier: in this model we did see a main effect of therapy ($p=.013$) but we did not see an interaction effect ($p=.125$). That's kind of telling us what we want to know, but it's not quite the same thing. What we really want is a single test that *jointly* checks the main effect of therapy and the interaction effect. \n",

On the other hand, if you recall the [chapter on regression](modelselreg), we were able to use $F$-tests to make comparisons between a wide variety of regression models. Perhaps something of that sort is possible with ANOVA? And of course, the answer here is yes. The thing that you really need to understand is that the $F$-test, as it is used in both ANOVA and regression, is really a comparison of *two* statistical models. One of these models is the full model (alternative hypothesis), and the other model is a simpler model that is missing one or more of the terms that the full model includes (null hypothesis). The null model cannot contain any terms that are not in the full model. In the example I gave above, the full model is `model2`, and it contains a main effect for therapy, a main effect for drug, and the drug by therapy interaction term. The null model would be `model1` since it contains only the main effect of drug. \n",

We'll say that our full model can be written as a `statsmodels` formula that contains several different terms, say `Y ~ A + B + C + D` (remember that `~` here can be read as \"predicted by\"). Our null model only contains some subset of these terms, say `Y ~ A + B`. Some of these terms might be main effect terms, others might be interaction terms. It really doesn't matter. The only thing that matters here is that we want to treat some of these terms as the \"starting point\" (i.e. the terms in the null model, `A` and `B`), and we want to see if including the other terms (i.e., `C` and `D`) leads to a significant improvement in model performance, over and above what could be achieved by a model that includes only `A` and `B`.\n",

    "To answer this, let's go back to fundamentals. As we saw back when we learned about [one-way ANOVA](ANOVA), the $F$-test is constructed from two kinds of quantity: sums of squares (SS) and degrees of freedom (df). These two things define a mean square value (MS = SS/df), and we obtain our $F$ statistic by contrasting the MS value associated with \"the thing we're interested in\" (the model) with the MS value associated with \"everything else\" (the residuals). What we want to do is figure out how to talk about the SS value that is associated with the *difference* between two models. It's actually not all that hard to do. \n",

    "At this point, it may help to go back to our concrete example. The null model here is `model1`, which stipulates that there is a main effect of drug, but no other effects exist. We expressed this via the model formula `mood_gain ~ drug`. The alternative model here is `model3`, which stipulates that there is a main effect of drug, a main effect of therapy, and an interaction. This model corresponds to the formula `mood_gain ~ drug + therapy + drug:therapy`. The key thing here is that if we compare `model1` to `model3`, we’re lumping the main effect of therapy and the interaction term together. Running this test in Python is straightforward: we just input both models to the `anova_lm` function from `statsmodels`, and it will run the exact F -test that I outlined above."

    "One of the most important things to understand about ANOVA and regression is that they're basically the same thing. On the surface of it, you wouldn't think that this is true: after all, the way that I've described them so far suggests that ANOVA is primarily concerned with testing for group differences, and regression is primarily concerned with understanding the correlations between variables. And as far as it goes, that's perfectly true. But when you look under the hood, so to speak, the underlying mechanics of ANOVA and regression are awfully similar. In fact, if you think about it, you've already seen evidence of this. ANOVA and regression both rely heavily on sums of squares (SS), both make use of $F$ tests, and so on. Looking back, it's hard to escape the feeling that the chapters on ANOVA and regression were a bit repetitive. \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason for this is that ANOVA and regression are both kinds of **_linear models_**. In the case of regression, this is kind of obvious. The regression equation that we use to define the relationship between predictors and outcomes *is* the equation for a straight line, so it's quite obviously a linear model. When we use e.g. a `pingouin` command like `pg.linear_regression([predictor1, predictor2], outcome)` what we're really working with is the somewhat uglier linear model:\n",

If we ignore the residuals $\\epsilon_{p}$ and just focus on the regression line itself, we get the following formula:\n",
